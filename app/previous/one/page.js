      <p>
        Unplugged 1.0 marked the beginning of a tradition that celebrated
        hardware innovation. Centered around the theme of Internet of Things,
        this inaugural edition encouraged participants to explore how devices
        could communicate, sense, and automate the world around them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams built interconnected systems using sensors, microcontrollers, and
        wireless communication modules to create smart environments capable of
        real-time monitoring and decision-making.
      </p>

      <p>
        From smart homes and automated agriculture setups to intelligent safety
        devices and health monitoring systems, Unplugged 1.0 showcased how IoT
        could bridge the gap between software intelligence and physical action.
      </p>

      <p>
        The event laid the foundation for a hardware-focused culture, where
        participants learned to think beyond screens and work with real circuits,
        signals, and devices.
      </p>

      <p>
        It established Unplugged as a platform where ideas turned into working
        prototypes within 24 intense hours of collaboration and creativity.
