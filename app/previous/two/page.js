      <p>
        Unplugged 2.0 evolved the vision from connected devices to connected
        cities. Inspired by the concept of a Smart Mumbai, this edition focused
        on solving urban challenges using hardware-driven solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Participants tackled problems related to traffic management, waste
        segregation, energy efficiency, public safety, and infrastructure
        monitoring using embedded systems and automation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams designed prototypes that could assist municipal systems, optimize
        city resources, and improve quality of life through intelligent sensing
        and data-driven hardware.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hackathon demonstrated how engineering innovation could be applied
        to large-scale environments and real civic challenges faced by
        metropolitan cities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unplugged 2.0 strengthened the event’s identity as a hub for practical,
        impactful, and socially relevant hardware innovation.
