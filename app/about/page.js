        Unplugged 3.0 is the flagship 24-hour national level hardware hackathon hosted by
        the IETE-ISF chapter of DJSCE. Designed as an immersive engineering expedition,
        this edition draws inspiration from the wild — placing innovation in the context
        of wildlife conservation, environmental monitoring, and sustainable ecosystems.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a world where technology often distances us from nature, Unplugged challenges
        participants to do the opposite. Here, engineers step into the role of field
        researchers, conservation technologists, and problem solvers who build real,
        tangible hardware systems that can monitor habitats, track wildlife, optimize
        resources, and protect fragile ecosystems.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a conventional coding hackathon. Participants work with sensors,
        microcontrollers, embedded systems, communication modules, and rapid prototyping
        tools to design solutions that exist beyond screens — solutions that could
        function in forests, reserves, villages, coastlines, and remote terrains.
      </p>

      <p>
        With over 40,000 impressions on Unstop and participation expected from students
        across the country, Unplugged 3.0 brings together some of the most passionate
        hardware enthusiasts, innovators, and problem solvers under one roof for a
        continuous 24-hour build experience.

        The theme of Jurassic wilderness is symbolic. It represents raw, untamed
        environments where survival depends on awareness, adaptation, and intelligent
        systems. Participants are encouraged to think beyond traditional project ideas
        and build devices that can sense, respond, and operate autonomously in natural
        surroundings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the hackathon, teams are evaluated not only on technical complexity
        but also on practicality, sustainability, and the potential real-world impact of
        their hardware prototypes. The focus lies on creating deployable, meaningful
        engineering solutions rather than theoretical concepts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Guided by mentors, evaluated by industry professionals, and supported by an
        enthusiastic organizing committee, Unplugged provides an atmosphere that is both
        competitive and collaborative — pushing participants to innovate under pressure
        while learning from one another.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, Unplugged has built a reputation for being a platform where
        hardware ideas come to life. Previous editions have seen groundbreaking
        prototypes, interdisciplinary teams, and a spirit of relentless curiosity that
        defines the essence of this event.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unplugged 3.0 is more than a hackathon. It is an expedition into engineering for
        the wild — where creativity meets circuitry, and innovation meets purpose.
